Midterm Project in Coding for Data Science

I created a shiny app that helps you to easily calculate the distribution of a sample, with a specific size, mean and you can choose between two types of distribution, Exponential and Normal. 
In the case of Normal disribution, it is important to indicate even the standard deviation, otherwise an error message appears: "invalid number of 'breaks'".
